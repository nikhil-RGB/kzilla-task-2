## Description:

This repository contains a basic counting app, which is the second assignment in the kzilla app development training sessions.

#### Main Objectives:

Make an app with flutter which has a single page and displays numbers from 1-10 in a ListView.
The app should have a floating action button, which when pressed changes the range from 1-random number(max 100).

#### Bonus Tasks:

Upon clicking on any element of the list, colour of the tile changes to red if the number>50, and green otherwise.
Keep the code organized in a proper file structure. Break widgets into smaller widgets wherever possible.
